                    <h2>Loaded With Nutrients</h2>
                    <p>Pineapples are low in calories but have an incredibly impressive nutrient profile.
                        Pineapples also contain trace amounts of vitamins A and K, phosphorus, zinc and calcium.
                        They are especially rich in vitamin C and manganese, providing 131% and 76% of the daily recommendations, respectively.
                        Vitamin C is essential for growth and development, a healthy immune system and aiding the absorption of iron from the diet. Meanwhile, manganese is a naturally occurring mineral that aids growth, maintains a healthy metabolism and has antioxidant properties.

                    <h2>Contains Disease-Fighting Antioxidants</h2>
                    <p>Not only are pineapples rich in nutrients, they are also loaded with healthy antioxidants.
                        Antioxidants are molecules that help your body combat oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is a state in which there are too many free radicals in the body. These free radicals interact with the body's cells and cause damage that is linked to chronic inflammation, a weakened immune system and many harmful diseases. Pineapples are especially rich in antioxidants known as flavonoids and phenolic acids.
                        Whatâ€™s more, many of the antioxidants in pineapple are bound. This allows the antioxidants to survive harsher conditions in the body and produce longer lasting effects.

                    <h2>Pineapple's Enzymes Can Ease Digestion
                    </h2>
                    <p>The scaly bumps on the outside are called "eyes." Slice it open, and you'll find bright yellow flesh that's both sweet and tart.
                        Pineapples contain a group of digestive enzymes known as bromelain.  They function as proteases, which break down protein molecules into their building blocks, such as amino acids and small peptides (11Trusted Source).
                        Once protein molecules are broken down, they are more easily absorbed across the small intestine. This can be especially helpful for people with pancreatic insufficiency, a condition in which the pancreas cannot make enough digestive enzymes .
                        For example, one study showed that participants with pancreatic insufficiency experienced better digestion after taking a digestive enzyme supplement containing bromelain, compared to taking the same digestive enzyme supplement without bromelain.
                        Bromelain is also widely used as a commercial meat tenderizer due to its ability to break down tough meat proteins.
