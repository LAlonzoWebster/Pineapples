                <h1>Pineapples</h1>
                <p>For centuries, pineapples were so rare that only very wealthy people could afford to buy them. Some people even rented the exotic fruit to display at dinner parties. Today, they grow in tropical and subtropical countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, India, and China. Grocers and markets carry them all over the world.

                    <h2>Kinds of Pineapple</h2>
                    <p>You might not notice when you buy one at the store, but there are different types of pineapples. In the U.S., the two most popular are the cylinder-shaped "Smooth Cayenne" with small spiky leaves and the "Extra Sweet" variety, which scientists created in a lab in Hawaii.

                    <h2>History of Pineapples</h2>
                    <p>When European explorers found a fruit that looked like a pine cone in South America in the 17th century, they called it a pineapple. The wild plant originates from the Paraná–Paraguay River drainages between southern Brazil and Paraguay. Little is known about domestication but it spread as a crop throughout South America, and it eventually reached the Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico, where it was cultivated by the Mayas and the Aztecs. The first European to encounter the pineapple was Columbus, in Guadeloupe on 4 November 1493, by which time cropped pineapple was a widely distributed and a stable component of the diet of native Americans. The Portuguese took the fruit from Brazil and introduced it into India by 1550.The 'Red Spanish' cultivar was also introduced by the Spanish from Latin America to the Philippines, and it was grown for textile use from at least the 17th century.
                        Charles II is presented with the first pineapple grown in England (1675 painting by Hendrik Danckerts).
                        Columbus brought the plant back to Spain and called it piña de Indes, meaning "pine of the Indians". The pineapple was documented in Peter Martyr's Decades of the New World in 1516 and Antonio Pigafetta's Le Voyage et Navigacion.. of 1526, and the first known illustration was in Oviedo's Historia General de Las Indias in 1535.
                        The pineapple fascinated Europeans as a fruit of colonialism but it could not be successfully cultivated in Europe for several centuries until Pieter de la Court developed a greenhouse horticulture near Leyden from about 1658. Pineapple plants were distributed from the Netherlands to English gardeners in 1719 and French ones in 1730.In England, the first pineapple was grown at Dorney Court, Dorney in Buckinghamshire, and a huge "pineapple stove" to heat the plants was built at the Chelsea Physic Garden in 1723. In France, King Louis XV was presented with a pineapple that had been grown at Versailles in 1733. In Russia, Catherine the Great ate pineapples grown on her own estates before 1796. Because of the expense of direct import and the enormous cost in equipment and labour required to grow them in a temperate climate, using hothouses called "pineries", pineapples soon became a symbol of wealth. They were initially used mainly for display at dinner parties, rather than being eaten, and were used again and again until they began to rot. By the second half of the 18th century, the production of the fruit on British estates had become the subject of great rivalry between wealthy aristocrats. John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore built a hothouse on his estate surmounted by a huge stone cupola 14 meters tall in the shape of the fruit; it is known as the Dunmore Pineapple. In architecture, pineapple figures became decorative elements symbolizing hospitality.
